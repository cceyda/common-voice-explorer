# Common Voice Dataset Explorer
[Common Voice Dataset](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/en/datasets) is by Mozilla


Made during [huggingface finetuning week](https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/open-to-the-community-xlsr-wav2vec2-fine-tuning-week-for-low-resource-languages/4467)

# Usage
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

`streamlit run common_voice.py`


# Details
- Made using streamlit
- Using https://github.com/PablocFonseca/streamlit-aggrid for interactivity, because you can't click plots yet.

I tried to put this together as quickly as I can, so it is not perfect.
